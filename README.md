# Time Capsule Journal

## Overview

Time Capsule Journal is a Django-based web application originally deployed on Heroku, created as a showcase of my skills in web development. This project is not intended for practical use, but rather to demonstrate various features and technologies.

## Features

- **Journal Entries:** Users can create personal journal entries to document their thoughts, experiences, and feelings.

- **Check-In System:** The application encourages users to check in at regular intervals. If a user fails to check in, the system can automatically notify selected contacts.

- **Contact Integration:** Users can add contacts to their Time Capsule Journal. If a user misses a check-in, the journal entry for that day can be automatically shared with selected contacts.

- **Payment Integration:** The project includes integration with the Stripe payment system, demonstrating the ability to incorporate third-party services.
